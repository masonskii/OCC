 ## Project: Code Execution and Translation API

### Introduction

This project provides a REST API for executing code and translating text. The API is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other applications.

### Code Execution

The code execution endpoint allows you to execute code in a variety of languages. To use the endpoint, you must provide the following parameters:

* `language`: The language of the code you want to execute.
* `code`: The code you want to execute.

The endpoint will return the output of the code as well as any errors that occurred during execution.

### Text Translation

The text translation endpoint allows you to translate text from one language to another. To use the endpoint, you must provide the following parameters:

* `text`: The text you want to translate.
* `before`: The language of the original text.
* `after`: The language you want to translate the text to.

The endpoint will return the translated text.

### Usage

To use the API, you can send a POST request to the following endpoints:

* `/runcode`: Execute code.
* `/translate`: Translate text.

The request body should contain the parameters described above.

### Example

The following example shows how to use the API to execute Python code:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"language": "python", "code": "print("Hello, world!")"}' http://localhost:8000/runcode
```

The response will be:

```
{
  "output": "Hello, world!",
  "error": null
}
```

The following example shows how to use the API to translate text from English to Spanish:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, world!", "before": "en", "after": "es"}' http://localhost:8000/translate
```

The response will be:

```
{
  "translated_text": "Â¡Hola, mundo!"
}
```

### Conclusion

This project provides a simple and easy-to-use API for executing code and translating text. The API can be used to build a variety of applications, such as code editors, IDEs, and translation tools.
